## Overview

Implement AI-powered features to provide intelligent habit recommendations, pattern recognition, and personalized insights to users.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Smart Suggestions
- AI-powered habit recommendations based on user behavior
- Suggest optimal habit combinations
- Recommend frequency adjustments based on completion patterns

### 2. Pattern Recognition  
- Analyze user completion patterns
- Identify time-of-day preferences
- Detect streaks and trends
- Predict habit success probability

### 3. Personalized Insights
- Weekly/monthly AI-generated reports
- Tips based on individual data
- Motivational messages triggered by patterns
- Warning alerts for habit decline

### 4. Adaptive Scheduling
- AI suggests optimal times for habit execution
- Learns from completion history
- Adjusts recommendations based on success rate
- Considers user's weekly patterns

## Implementation Plan (4 Weeks)

### Week 1: Research & Architecture
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Evaluate ML frameworks (Google ML Kit vs TensorFlow Lite)
- [ ] Design pattern recognition algorithms
- [ ] Create data models for AI features
- [ ] Set up AI service architecture
- [ ] Add dependencies to pubspec.yaml

**Deliverables**:
- Technical decision document
- Architecture diagram
- Data models defined

---

### Week 2: Pattern Recognition (Core)
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement `pattern_analyzer.dart`
  - Completion frequency analysis
  - Time-of-day pattern detection
  - Streak identification
  - Success rate calculation
- [ ] Create unit tests for pattern analysis
- [ ] Integrate with existing `HabitProvider`

**Deliverables**:
- Functional pattern analyzer
- 20+ unit tests
- Integration with habit data

---

### Week 3: Suggestions & Insights
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement `suggestion_engine.dart`
  - Habit recommendations logic
  - Frequency optimization
  - Timing suggestions
- [ ] Implement `insight_generator.dart`
  - Weekly report generation
  - Personalized tips
  - Motivational messages
- [ ] Create `ai_provider.dart` for state management

**Deliverables**:
- Suggestion engine functional
- Insight generator working
- State management integrated

---

### Week 4: UI Integration & Testing
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `insights_screen.dart`
  - AI insights display
  - Suggestion cards
  - Pattern visualization
- [ ] Add AI tab/section to main navigation
- [ ] Integrate with existing screens
- [ ] Add i18n strings (EN + ES)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing (unit + integration)
- [ ] Performance optimization

**Deliverables**:
- Complete UI for AI features
- All tests passing
- Documentation updated

---

## Data Requirements

### User Data to Analyze
- Habit completion history (last 90 days)
- Time of completion
- Completion frequency
- Streak data
- User-set goals vs actual performance

### Privacy Considerations
- All processing done locally (no external API calls)
- No personal data sent to cloud
- Opt-in for AI features
- Clear data usage explanation

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- [ ] Pattern recognition accuracy >80%
- [ ] Suggestions relevance >70% (user feedback)
- [ ] Response time <2s for analysis
- [ ] Zero crashes related to AI features

### Phase 2 (Optimization)
- [ ] User engagement with insights >50%
- [ ] Accepted suggestions >30%
- [ ] Positive user feedback >4.0/5.0

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Performance Impact
**Mitigation**: Run analysis in background isolate, cache results

### Risk 2: Inaccurate Suggestions
**Mitigation**: Start with rule-based system, iterate based on feedback

### Risk 3: Complexity Overhead
**Mitigation**: Implement MVP first, add advanced features incrementally

---

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Integration with external LLM (GPT-4, Claude) for natural language insights
- Voice-based habit suggestions
- Social comparison (anonymized patterns)
- Habit recommendation marketplace

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Evaluate ML frameworks (Week 1)
2. **Short-term**: Implement pattern analyzer (Week 2)
3. **Medium-term**: Build suggestion engine (Week 3)
4. **Launch**: Full integration and testing (Week 4)

**Status**: 📋 PLANNED  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**Target Completion**: 4 weeks from start  
**Owner**: Development Team
